## Presentation : 

My First project using React. Student project for educational purpose. 

The idea was to take the previous project KoiKonRegarde made as a collective project at Ada Tech school and put it in another level, using React to create a more actual interface, with search engine, randomizer, and current releases. 

The project is based on the tutorial made by JS Dev Hindi : https://youtu.be/VLgVw2NEqCM?si=pspDmj9RLv84xf8P

As a first project it was really useful to reuse and improve a previous project, and use it inside of a tutorial that made me learn React. 

## Last update : 
```
Addition of a KoiKonRegarde logo
addition of a second button to have a new random movie by using the first genre of the previous movie

```

## Future updates : 

```
searching and adding JustWatch API and french theaters API to show where to see the movies
rework of the SCSS to be translate to Tailwind
correction of mobile views issues
adding a dark mode
...maybe working on a electron desktop app ? a React Native app ? sky is the limit
will remove the possiblity to watch the movie like a pirate, but might keep it with a easter egg maybe
```
