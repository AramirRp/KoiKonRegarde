**KoiKonRegarde - React version
**
First project using React. Student project for educational purpose. 

The idea was to take the previous project KoiKonRegarde made as a collective project at Ada Tech school and put it in another level, using React to create a more actual interface, with search engine, randomizer, and current releases. 

WIP updates : 
- searching and adding JustWatch API and french theaters API to show where to see the movies
- adding randomizer with genre filter after a first choice
- rework of the SCSS and the global flow of the website
- creating a KoiKonRegarde logo
  ...and lot of other stuff ! 

The website is using TMDB API, React, redux, Sass.

The project is based on the tutorial made by JS Dev Hindi : https://youtu.be/VLgVw2NEqCM?si=pspDmj9RLv84xf8P
